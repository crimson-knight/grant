# Phase 2 Progress Summary

## Completed Features

### 1. Polymorphic Associations ✅
- Full implementation of polymorphic `belongs_to`
- Support for `has_many` and `has_one` with `:as` option
- Automatic type registration for all Granite::Base subclasses
- Custom column name support
- Complete documentation with examples

**Files Added/Modified:**
- `src/granite/polymorphic.cr` - Core polymorphic implementation
- `src/granite/associations.cr` - Integration with existing associations
- `docs/polymorphic_associations.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `spec/granite/associations/polymorphic_simple_spec.cr` - Basic tests

### 2. Advanced Association Options ✅

#### Dependent Options
- `dependent: :destroy` - Cascading deletes
- `dependent: :nullify` - Nullify foreign keys
- `dependent: :restrict` - Prevent deletion with associations

#### Additional Options
- `optional: true` - Optional belongs_to associations
- `counter_cache: true` - Automatic count maintenance
- `touch: true` - Parent timestamp updates
- `autosave: true` - Automatic associated record saving

**Files Added/Modified:**
- `src/granite/association_options.cr` - Options implementation
- `src/granite/associations.cr` - Integration into association macros
- `docs/advanced_associations.md` - Detailed documentation
- `spec/granite/associations/association_options_spec.cr` - Test coverage

## Still Pending from Phase 2

### 2.1 Advanced Associations
- Self-Referential Associations
- `inverse_of:` option
- Association Extensions
- Has Many Through with Source

### 2.2 Attribute Features
- Attribute API with custom types
- Store Accessors for JSON/Hash
- Enum Attributes with helper methods
- Serialized Attributes

### 2.3 Validations
- Built-in validators (numericality, format, confirmation, etc.)
- Validation contexts
- Conditional validations
- Custom validator classes

### 2.4 Database Features
- Database Views Support
- Prepared Statements improvements
- Connection Pooling Configuration
- Multiple Database Support
- Database-specific features (PostgreSQL arrays, JSONB, etc.)

## Next Steps

1. **Enum Attributes** - This would be a good next feature as it's commonly used
2. **Built-in Validators** - Essential for any production application
3. **Attribute API** - Provides foundation for custom types and type casting

## Technical Achievements

1. **Macro Design Patterns** - Established patterns for extending associations with options
2. **Callback Integration** - Leveraged existing callback system for new features
3. **Type Safety** - Maintained Crystal's type safety while adding dynamic features
4. **Rails Compatibility** - Maintained familiar Rails API while adapting to Crystal

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Polymorphic Type Resolution** - Solved using a type registry pattern
2. **Abstract Class Instantiation** - Worked around Crystal's restrictions with dynamic typing
3. **Macro Scope Issues** - Resolved through careful macro structuring
4. **Query Builder Extensions** - Added `update_all` and `exists?` methods

## Documentation

All new features have been thoroughly documented with:
- API references
- Usage examples
- Best practices
- Migration guides
- Troubleshooting sections

The documentation follows Crystal's documentation standards and provides Rails developers with familiar concepts and patterns.
