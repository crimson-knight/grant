# Phase 1 Compilation Fixes

## Summary
During the implementation of Phase 1 features, I encountered and fixed several compilation errors. The code now compiles but there's a dependency issue with the pg shard that prevents running the full test suite.

## Compilation Errors Fixed

### 1. Query Builder Case Statement
**File**: `src/granite/query/builder.cr`
**Issue**: Case statement without else clause returns Nil
**Fix**: Added else clause with raise statement

### 2. Association Loader Query Syntax
**File**: `src/granite/association_loader.cr`
**Issue**: Hash syntax not supported in where clause
**Fix**: Changed from `where(key => values)` to `where(key, :in, values)`

### 3. Metadata Retrieval
**File**: `src/granite/association_loader.cr`
**Issue**: Runtime metadata access attempted with compile-time macros
**Fix**: Simplified to return nil (TODO: implement proper metadata system)

### 4. Dirty Tracking Macro Timing
**File**: `src/granite/dirty.cr`, `src/granite/base.cr`
**Issue**: Macro trying to access instance vars before initialization
**Fix**: Commented out `setup_dirty_tracking` call (TODO: fix macro timing)

### 5. Scoping Annotations
**File**: `src/granite/scoping.cr`
**Issue**: Class variables cannot have JSON/YAML field annotations
**Fix**: Removed annotations from class property

### 6. Database Type Access
**File**: `src/granite/scoping.cr`
**Issue**: `adapter.database_type` method doesn't exist
**Fix**: Used same pattern as in `builder_methods.cr` to determine DB type from adapter class name

### 7. Duplicate Methods
**File**: `src/granite/query/builder.cr`
**Issue**: Duplicate `all` and `first` methods added
**Fix**: Removed duplicate methods

## Remaining Issues

### PG Shard Compatibility
There's a type mismatch in the pg shard (lib/pg/src/pg/result_set.cr:18) that prevents the test suite from running:
```
Error: expected argument #3 to 'PG::ResultSet::Buffer.new' to be PG::Connection, not DB::Connection
```

This appears to be a version compatibility issue between the pg shard (0.27.0) and crystal-db (0.12.0).

## TODO for Full Functionality

1. **Fix Dirty Tracking Macro**: The `setup_dirty_tracking` macro needs to be restructured to work with Crystal's macro expansion timing
2. **Implement Association Metadata**: Create a proper runtime metadata system for associations to support eager loading
3. **Update Dependencies**: May need to update or pin specific versions of database shards for compatibility
4. **Add Integration Tests**: Once compilation issues are resolved, add comprehensive integration tests for all Phase 1 features

## Recommendations

1. Consider using a different approach for dirty tracking that doesn't rely on complex macro timing
2. For association metadata, consider using a registry pattern that's populated at compile time
3. Test with different database adapters individually to isolate issues
4. Consider creating a minimal test suite that doesn't require all database adapters

Despite these compilation challenges, the core implementations of all Phase 1 features are in place:
- Eager Loading infrastructure
- Dirty Tracking API (minus automatic method generation)
- Lifecycle Callbacks
- Named Scopes and Advanced Querying
