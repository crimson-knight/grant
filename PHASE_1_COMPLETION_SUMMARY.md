# Phase 1 Completion Summary

## Overview

Phase 1 of the Grant ORM enhancement project has been successfully completed. This phase focused on implementing critical infrastructure for multiple database support and laying the foundation for database sharding.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Composite Primary Key Support ✅
- Created `Granite::CompositePrimaryKey` module as an opt-in feature
- Implemented DSL macro `composite_primary_key` for easy declaration
- Added query methods: `find`, `find!`, `exists?` with composite key support
- Implemented automatic validation for presence and uniqueness
- Added helper methods for working with composite keys
- Created comprehensive test suite with 12 passing tests

### 2. Adapter Extensions ✅
- Added `update_with_where` method to base adapter for custom WHERE clauses
- Added `delete_with_where` method to base adapter for custom WHERE clauses
- These methods enable composite key operations and future sharding needs

### 3. CI/CD Infrastructure ✅
- Updated Crystal versions from 1.6.x to 1.14.0-latest
- Modernized GitHub Actions to v4
- Added separate primary/replica database instances for all adapters
- Created dedicated sharding workflow with multi-shard PostgreSQL setup
- Added failover testing workflow for connection resilience
- Documented CI configuration and testing procedures

### 4. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive sharding design document
- Developed 6-week implementation roadmap
- Documented various sharding strategies
- Added examples and usage guides
- Created CI configuration documentation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Composite Key Module Structure
```crystal
module Granite::CompositePrimaryKey
  ├── CompositeKey struct         # Manages key configuration
  ├── Transactions module         # Transaction support (foundation)
  ├── Validation module          # Automatic validations
  └── DSL macro                  # composite_primary_key declaration
```

### Usage Example
```crystal
class OrderItem < Granite::Base
  include Granite::CompositePrimaryKey
  
  column order_id : Int64, primary: true
  column product_id : Int64, primary: true
  
  composite_primary_key order_id, product_id
end

# Query by composite key
item = OrderItem.find(order_id: 123, product_id: 456)
```

## Current Limitations

1. **Transaction Support**: Save/update/destroy operations need deeper integration with Granite's transaction system
2. **Associations**: Composite foreign keys not yet implemented
3. **Migrations**: Table creation with composite keys needs migration support

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Complete Transaction Integration**
   - Modify private `__create`, `__update`, `__destroy` methods
   - Test full CRUD operations with composite keys

2. **Begin Sharding Infrastructure**
   - Implement ShardResolver classes
   - Create sharding DSL
   - Build cross-shard query support

3. **Connection Management**
   - Enhance connection registry for shard management
   - Implement connection pooling per shard
   - Add automatic failover mechanisms

## CI/CD Status

The updated CI configuration now supports:
- Modern Crystal versions (1.14.0+)
- Multiple database instances (primary/replica)
- Sharding test infrastructure (4 shards with replicas)
- Failover testing capabilities
