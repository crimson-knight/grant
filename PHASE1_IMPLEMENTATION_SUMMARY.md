# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 1 of the Grant (formerly Grant) ORM upgrade has been completed. This phase focused on implementing critical missing features needed for ActiveRecord parity.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Eager Loading & Association Optimization
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/grant/eager_loading.cr` - Core eager loading module
- `src/grant/association_loader.cr` - Association batch loading logic
- `src/grant/loaded_association_collection.cr` - Collection wrapper for pre-loaded associations
- `src/grant/associations.cr` - Modified to support eager loading cache
- `src/grant/query/builder.cr` - Added includes, preload, eager_load methods
- `spec/grant/eager_loading/eager_loading_spec.cr` - Tests

**Features:**
- `Model.includes(:association)` - Eager load associations
- `Model.preload(:association)` - Preload associations in separate queries
- `Model.eager_load(:association)` - Load with LEFT OUTER JOIN
- Nested eager loading: `Model.includes(posts: :comments)`
- Association caching to prevent repeated queries
- N+1 query prevention

**Usage:**
```crystal
# Eager load posts with their comments and authors
posts = Post.includes(:comments, :author).all

# Nested eager loading
posts = Post.includes(comments: [:author, :likes]).all

# No additional queries when accessing associations
posts.each do |post|
  puts post.author.name # Uses cached data
  post.comments.each { |c| puts c.text } # Uses cached data
end
```

### 2. Dirty Tracking API
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/grant/dirty.cr` - Complete dirty tracking implementation
- `spec/grant/dirty/dirty_tracking_spec.cr` - Comprehensive tests

**Features:**
- Track attribute changes before save
- `attribute_changed?` - Check if specific attribute changed
- `attribute_was` - Get original value
- `attribute_change` - Get [old, new] tuple
- `changes` - Get all changes hash
- `changed?` - Check if any attributes changed
- `changed_attributes` - List of changed attribute names
- `previous_changes` - Changes from last save
- `saved_changes` - Alias for previous_changes
- `restore_attributes` - Revert changes
- Automatic dirty state clearing after save

**Usage:**
```crystal
user = User.find(1)
user.name # => "John"
user.name = "Jane"

user.name_changed? # => true
user.name_was # => "John"
user.name_change # => ["John", "Jane"]
user.changes # => {"name" => ["John", "Jane"]}

user.save
user.name_changed? # => false
user.previous_changes # => {"name" => ["John", "Jane"]}
```

### 3. Lifecycle Callbacks
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/grant/callbacks.cr` - Extended with new callbacks and conditional support
- `src/grant/commit_callbacks.cr` - Transaction-aware callbacks
- Various files updated to trigger callbacks at appropriate times
- `spec/grant/callbacks/lifecycle_callbacks_spec.cr` - Tests

**New Callbacks:**
- `after_initialize` - After object instantiation
- `after_find` - After loading from database
- `before_validation` / `after_validation` - Around validation
- `after_touch` - After touching timestamp
- `after_commit` - After database transaction commits
- `after_rollback` - After transaction rollback
- `after_create_commit` - After create transaction commits
- `after_update_commit` - After update transaction commits
- `after_destroy_commit` - After destroy transaction commits

**Conditional Callbacks:**
```crystal
before_save :normalize_name, if: :name_changed?
after_update :send_email, unless: :skip_notifications?
```

### 4. Named Scopes & Advanced Querying
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/grant/scoping.cr` - Complete scoping system
- `src/grant/query/builder.cr` - Enhanced with or/not support
- `spec/grant/scoping/scoping_spec.cr` - Tests

**Features:**
- Named scopes with `scope` macro
- Default scopes with `default_scope`
- `unscoped` to bypass default scope
- Scope merging with `merge`
- Query extensions with `extending`
- Enhanced `or` and `not` query support

**Usage:**
```crystal
class Post < Grant::Base
  # Named scopes
  scope :published, ->(q) { q.where(published: true) }
  scope :recent, ->(q) { q.order(created_at: :desc) }
  scope :featured, ->(q) { q.where(featured: true) }
  
  # Default scope
  default_scope { where(deleted_at: nil) }
end

# Using scopes
Post.published.recent.limit(10)
Post.featured.or { where(views: :gt, 1000) }

# Bypass default scope
Post.unscoped.where(deleted_at: :not_nil)

# Complex queries
Post.where(author_id: 1).or do |q|
  q.where(featured: true)
  q.where(views: :gt, 1000)
end.not do |q|
  q.where(archived: true)
end
```

## Integration Notes

All new features have been integrated into the `Grant::Base` class and are automatically available to all models. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding these new capabilities.

## Testing

Each feature includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Eager loading tests verify N+1 prevention and correct association loading
- Dirty tracking tests cover all change tracking scenarios
- Callback tests ensure correct execution order and conditional behavior
- Scoping tests validate scope chaining and default scope behavior

## Next Steps

Phase 1 provides the foundation for more advanced features in subsequent phases:
- Phase 2: Polymorphic associations, advanced association options, attribute API
- Phase 3: Query caching, STI support, advanced query features
- Phase 4: Convenience methods, schema enhancements, testing support

## Breaking Changes

None. All Phase 1 features are additive and maintain backward compatibility.

## Performance Considerations

- Eager loading significantly reduces database queries in N+1 scenarios
- Dirty tracking has minimal overhead (only tracks changed attributes)
- Callbacks add slight overhead but follow the same pattern as existing callbacks
- Scoping adds no runtime overhead for models without scopes

## Migration from Grant to Grant

To use these new features in existing Grant applications:
1. Update your dependency to use Grant
2. No code changes required for existing functionality
3. New features are opt-in and can be adopted gradually
