# Active Record Feature Analysis for Grant

This directory contains a comprehensive analysis of Active Record features compared to Grant's current implementation.

## Directory Structure

- **`complete/`** - Features that Grant has fully implemented
- **`partial/`** - Features that Grant has partially implemented but need completion
- **`not_needed/`** - Features that Crystal's type system or language features make unnecessary
- **`to_implement/`** - Features that Grant should implement for full parity

## Analysis Categories

1. **Core Features** - Fundamental ORM functionality
2. **Query Interface** - Query building and execution
3. **Associations** - Relationship management
4. **Validations** - Data validation
5. **Callbacks** - Lifecycle hooks
6. **Performance** - Caching, optimization, locking
7. **Security** - Encryption, sanitization, tokens
8. **Advanced Features** - Specialized functionality

## Key Findings Summary

### Crystal Advantages
- Type system eliminates need for many runtime checks
- Compile-time validation reduces need for some features
- Native concurrency with fibers replaces async/promises
- Macros provide powerful metaprogramming

### Major Gaps
1. Encryption support
2. Optimistic/Pessimistic locking
3. Query caching
4. Nested attributes
5. Advanced calculations with async
6. Aggregations
7. Secure tokens/passwords

### Quick Stats
