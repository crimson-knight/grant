# Phase 4 Implementation Progress

## Completed Features

### Convenience Methods
1. **pluck** - Extract one or more columns from records ✅
   - Single column support
   - Multiple column support
   - Integration with query builder

2. **pick** - Extract columns from a single record ✅
   - Implemented as limit(1).pluck.first?

3. **in_batches** - Process records in batches ✅
   - Configurable batch size
   - Start/finish constraints
   - Order support (asc/desc)

4. **insert_all** - Bulk insert with options ✅
   - Automatic timestamps
   - Returning clause support
   - Unique constraint handling

5. **upsert_all** - Bulk upsert operations ✅
   - Insert or update on conflict
   - Update only specific columns
   - Database-specific implementations

6. **annotate** - Add comments to queries ✅
   - Query annotation support for debugging

## Known Issues & TODO

### Resolved Issues ✅
1. **Range Query Support** 
   - Fixed operator mapping (`:gteq`/`:lteq` instead of `:gte`/`:lte`)
   - Range queries now properly translate to >= and <= SQL operations
   - Parameters are correctly passed through assembler instances

2. **Bulk Operations Parameter Passing**
   - Fixed issue where parameters weren't being collected
   - Assembler instances are now properly reused within operations
   - NULL constraint errors resolved

3. **in_batches Improvements**
   - Fixed batch iteration logic
   - Properly handles start/finish constraints
   - Correctly processes all records without skipping

### Remaining Issues

### Database-Specific Behavior (Resolved)
- ✅ SQLite now requires version 3.24.0+ with proper ON CONFLICT support
- ✅ Version check implemented at adapter initialization
- ✅ Consistent upsert behavior across all databases
- ⚠️ RETURNING clause support still varies by database adapter (PostgreSQL full support, MySQL none, SQLite limited)

### Testing Improvements Needed
- Better test isolation to prevent data contamination between tests
- Cross-database compatibility testing
- Performance benchmarking for bulk operations

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Query Builder Integration**: All convenience methods are added as modules to the Query::Builder class
2. **Database Abstraction**: Each database adapter (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) has its own SQL generation
3. **Type Safety**: Using Crystal's type system to ensure compile-time safety

### Performance Considerations
1. **Batch Processing**: in_batches uses efficient cursor-based pagination
2. **Bulk Operations**: insert_all and upsert_all use single SQL statements for efficiency
3. **Pluck Optimization**: Custom executor to avoid full model instantiation

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining test failures
2. Add documentation for all convenience methods
3. Test cross-database compatibility
4. Performance benchmarking
5. Consider adding more convenience methods from Rails 8
