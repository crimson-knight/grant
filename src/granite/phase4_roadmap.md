# Phase 4 Implementation Progress

## Completed Features

### Convenience Methods
1. **pluck** - Extract one or more columns from records ✅
   - Single column support
   - Multiple column support
   - Integration with query builder

2. **pick** - Extract columns from a single record ✅
   - Implemented as limit(1).pluck.first?

3. **in_batches** - Process records in batches ✅
   - Configurable batch size
   - Start/finish constraints
   - Order support (asc/desc)

4. **insert_all** - Bulk insert with options ✅
   - Automatic timestamps
   - Returning clause support
   - Unique constraint handling

5. **upsert_all** - Bulk upsert operations ✅
   - Insert or update on conflict
   - Update only specific columns
   - Database-specific implementations

6. **annotate** - Add comments to queries ✅
   - Query annotation support for debugging

## Known Issues & TODO

### Range Query Support
- Range queries (e.g., `where(age: 30..40)`) need proper handling
- Currently converting to >= and <= operations, but may need exclusive range support

### Bulk Operations
- Need to handle NULL constraint errors better
- SQL generation for different databases needs testing
- Returning clause support is database-specific

### Testing
- Some tests are failing due to order expectations
- Need to add more comprehensive test coverage
- Cross-database compatibility testing needed

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Query Builder Integration**: All convenience methods are added as modules to the Query::Builder class
2. **Database Abstraction**: Each database adapter (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite) has its own SQL generation
3. **Type Safety**: Using Crystal's type system to ensure compile-time safety

### Performance Considerations
1. **Batch Processing**: in_batches uses efficient cursor-based pagination
2. **Bulk Operations**: insert_all and upsert_all use single SQL statements for efficiency
3. **Pluck Optimization**: Custom executor to avoid full model instantiation

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining test failures
2. Add documentation for all convenience methods
3. Test cross-database compatibility
4. Performance benchmarking
5. Consider adding more convenience methods from Rails 8
