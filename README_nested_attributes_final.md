# Nested Attributes Implementation - Final Version

## Summary

Successfully implemented a type-safe nested attributes feature for Grant that integrates with Crystal's compile-time type system.

### Key Improvements:

1. **Type-Safe API**: 
   ```crystal
   # Explicit type declaration syntax
   accepts_nested_attributes_for posts : Post, 
     allow_destroy: true,
     reject_if: :all_blank,
     limit: 5
   ```

2. **Proper Save Integration**:
   - Uses `macro finished` to override `save` and `save!` methods after all modules are included
   - Automatically processes nested attributes when parent is saved
   - Wraps operations in transactions for data integrity

3. **Full Persistence Support**:
   - Creates new nested records with proper foreign key assignment
   - Updates existing nested records by ID
   - Destroys nested records when `_destroy` flag is set
   - Respects all configuration options

### Implementation Details:

- The macro extracts type information from the TypeDeclaration syntax
- Generates specific methods for each association to handle persistence
- Uses Granite's existing `set_attributes` method for safe attribute assignment
- Propagates errors from nested records to parent model
- Clears nested data after successful save

### Configuration Options:

- `allow_destroy: true/false` - Enable destruction of nested records
- `update_only: true/false` - Only allow updates, no creation
- `limit: N` - Limit number of nested records
- `reject_if: :all_blank` - Reject attributes where all values are blank

### Example Usage:

```crystal
class Author < Granite::Base
  has_many :posts
  has_one :profile
  
  accepts_nested_attributes_for posts : Post, 
    allow_destroy: true,
    reject_if: :all_blank,
    limit: 5
    
  accepts_nested_attributes_for profile : Profile,
    update_only: true
end

# Usage
author = Author.new(name: "John Doe")
author.posts_attributes = [
  { title: "First Post", content: "Content 1" },
  { title: "Second Post", content: "Content 2" }
]
author.save # Saves author and creates nested posts
```

### Technical Achievement:

This implementation successfully bridges the gap between Ruby's dynamic nested attributes pattern and Crystal's static type system by:

1. Requiring explicit type declarations for compile-time safety
2. Using Crystal's macro system to generate type-specific code
3. Leveraging `macro finished` to properly hook into the save lifecycle
4. Working within Crystal's constraints while maintaining a familiar API

The nested attributes feature is now fully functional with persistence support!
