# Horizontal Sharding Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've completed the research and design phase for implementing horizontal sharding in Grant (issue #12). This is indeed a complex feature that requires careful consideration of many factors including data distribution, query routing, distributed transactions, and testing strategies.

## What I Discovered

Grant already has a surprising amount of sharding infrastructure in place:

1. **Shard Resolvers**: Hash, Range, and Lookup-based strategies
2. **Connection Management**: The ConnectionRegistry already supports shard-aware connections
3. **Async Infrastructure**: ShardedExecutor for parallel operations across shards
4. **Basic Model Support**: Models can already define sharding configuration

However, several critical pieces are missing:

1. **ShardManager**: The central coordinator referenced in code but not implemented
2. **Query Router**: Logic to route queries to appropriate shards
3. **Cross-Shard Queries**: Scatter-gather and result merging
4. **Distributed Transactions**: Coordinating writes across multiple shards
5. **Testing Infrastructure**: Way to test sharding without multiple databases

## Design Approach

I've designed a type-safe, Crystal-idiomatic API that leverages the language's strengths:

### 1. Type-Safe Shard Configuration

Instead of Ruby's hash-based configuration, I've designed enum-based strategies:

```crystal
class User < Grant::Base
  include Grant::Sharding::Model
  
  # Hash sharding on user ID
  sharded strategy: :hash,
          on: :id,
          count: 8
end

class Order < Grant::Base
  # Geographic sharding
  sharded strategy: :geographic,
          on: :region,
          mapping: {
            "us-east" => :shard_us_east,
            "us-west" => :shard_us_west,
            "eu" => :shard_eu
          }
end
```

### 2. Query API

Intuitive API that clearly shows intent:

```crystal
# Query specific shard
User.on_shard(:shard_1).where(active: true)

# Query all shards (scatter-gather)
total_users = User.on_all_shards.count

# Query is automatically routed if shard key present
User.find(123) # Automatically routes to correct shard
```

### 3. Distributed Transactions

Two approaches for different consistency requirements:

```crystal
# Two-phase commit for strong consistency
User.distributed_transaction do |tx|
  tx.on_shard(:shard_1) do
    user1.save!
  end
  tx.on_shard(:shard_2) do
    user2.save!
  end
end

# Saga pattern for eventual consistency
saga = Grant::Sharding::Saga.new
saga.add_step(
  forward: -> { debit_account(100) },
  compensate: -> { credit_account(100) }
)
saga.execute
```

### 4. Virtual Sharding for Tests

A major innovation - test sharding without multiple databases:

```crystal
describe "Sharding" do
  it "routes queries correctly" do
    with_virtual_shards(4) do
      user = User.create!(id: 123)
      
      assert_queries_on_shard(:shard_2) do
        User.find(123)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Integration with Async Features

The sharding implementation leverages Grant's async capabilities:

```crystal
# Parallel execution across shards
results = Async::ShardedExecutor.execute_across_shards(shards) do |shard|
  AsyncResult.new do
    ShardManager.with_shard(shard) do
      User.where(active: true).count
    end
  end
end
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Fiber-Aware Context**: Using Fiber instead of Thread for shard context
2. **Type-Safe Enums**: Lock modes, strategies, etc. are enums not strings
3. **Fail-Fast Philosophy**: Clear errors for missing shard keys
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add features as needed
5. **Test-First Approach**: Virtual sharding enables TDD

## Implementation Plan

I've created a phased approach focusing on delivering value incrementally:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- ShardManager implementation
- Basic query routing
- Single-shard queries

### Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure  
- Virtual shard adapter
- Test helpers and matchers
- Basic test coverage

### Phase 3: Cross-Shard Queries
- Scatter-gather execution
- Result merging
- Query optimization

### Phase 4: Distributed Transactions
- Two-phase commit
- Saga pattern
- Failure handling

### Phase 5: Production Tools
- Monitoring and metrics
- Migration tools
- Rebalancing support

## Testing Strategy

Comprehensive testing without requiring multiple physical databases:

1. **Virtual Shards**: In-memory simulation of multiple databases
2. **Query Tracking**: Verify queries go to correct shards
3. **Failure Simulation**: Test network partitions, shard failures
4. **Performance Tests**: Ensure parallel execution is faster

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing ShardManager as the foundation
2. Create virtual sharding infrastructure for testing
3. Build basic query routing functionality
4. Create example applications demonstrating usage
5. Gather feedback and iterate on the design

## Documents Created

1. **HORIZONTAL_SHARDING_DESIGN.md**: Comprehensive technical design (2000+ lines)
2. **SHARDING_PATTERNS_RESEARCH.md**: Analysis of sharding strategies
3. **SHARDING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Phased implementation approach

## Conclusion

Horizontal sharding is indeed complex, but by building on Grant's existing infrastructure and leveraging Crystal's type system, we can create a solution that is both powerful and developer-friendly. The virtual sharding approach for testing is particularly innovative and will make this feature much more accessible to developers.

The design prioritizes:
- Type safety to prevent common errors
- Clear, intuitive APIs
- Testability without infrastructure complexity
- Performance through async execution
- Incremental delivery of value

This foundation will enable Grant to scale to massive datasets while maintaining the excellent developer experience that Crystal provides.
