# Phase 1 Implementation - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Phase 1 of Grant ORM's ActiveRecord parity implementation has been successfully completed. This phase focused on implementing critical missing features that provide core functionality for modern web applications.

## Completed Features

### 1. Eager Loading & Query Optimization
- ✅ `includes` - Smart loading that prevents N+1 queries
- ✅ `preload` - Force separate queries for associations
- ✅ `eager_load` - Force LEFT OUTER JOIN loading
- ✅ Association loader system for efficient batch loading

### 2. Dirty Tracking API
- ✅ Full Rails-compatible dirty tracking implementation
- ✅ Core methods: `changed?`, `changes`, `changed_attributes`, etc.
- ✅ Per-attribute methods: `<attr>_changed?`, `<attr>_was`, `<attr>_change`, `<attr>_before_last_save`
- ✅ Save integration with `previous_changes` and `saved_changes`
- ✅ `restore_attributes` functionality
- ✅ Compatible with JSON::Serializable and YAML::Serializable

### 3. Advanced Callbacks
- ✅ `after_initialize` - Run after object instantiation
- ✅ `after_find` - Run after loading from database
- ✅ Validation callbacks: `before_validation`, `after_validation`
- ✅ Commit callbacks: `after_commit`, `after_rollback`
- ✅ Specific commit callbacks: `after_create_commit`, `after_update_commit`, `after_destroy_commit`

### 4. Named Scopes & Advanced Querying
- ✅ Named scopes with `scope` macro
- ✅ Default scopes with `default_scope`
- ✅ `unscoped` to bypass default scope
- ✅ Scope chaining and composition

## Testing

All features have been thoroughly tested:
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for dirty tracking
- ✅ Tests pass on SQLite adapter
- ✅ Implementation works at Crystal object level, ensuring compatibility across all database adapters

## Documentation

Complete documentation has been provided:
- ✅ Inline Crystal documentation with examples for all methods
- ✅ Comprehensive user guide in `docs/dirty_tracking.md`
- ✅ Updated feature documentation in `GRANITE_CURRENT_FEATURES.md`
- ✅ Implementation notes in module documentation

## Architecture Decisions

### Dirty Tracking Integration
Instead of a separate module, dirty tracking was integrated directly into:
- `Grant::Base` - Core dirty tracking methods and storage
- `Grant::Columns` - Per-attribute method generation in column macro

This approach ensures:
- Better performance with minimal overhead
- Full compatibility with JSON/YAML serialization
- Cleaner API without module inclusion requirements

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the foundation is set for:
- Phase 2: Essential features like polymorphic associations, attribute API
- Phase 3: Performance features like query caching, batch operations
- Phase 4: Advanced features like multi-database support, sharding

## Breaking Changes

None. All Phase 1 features are additive and maintain backward compatibility.

## Migration Guide

No migration required. Simply update to the latest version to access all Phase 1 features.
