# Composite Primary Key Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented Phase 1.1 and partial Phase 1.2 of the sharding plan by adding composite primary key support to Grant ORM.

## What was implemented:

### 1. Core Module Structure
- Created `Grant::CompositePrimaryKey` module that can be included in models
- Created `CompositeKey` struct to manage composite key configuration
- Added DSL macro `composite_primary_key` for declaring composite keys

### 2. Query Support
- Implemented `find(**keys)` method for finding by composite keys
- Implemented `find!(**keys)` method that raises when not found
- Implemented `exists?(**keys)` method for checking existence
- Added WHERE clause generation for composite keys

### 3. Validation Support
- Added automatic validation for composite key presence
- Added automatic validation for composite key uniqueness
- Validations are integrated with Grant's validation system

### 4. Helper Methods
- `composite_primary_key?` - checks if model uses composite keys
- `composite_primary_key_columns` - returns array of key column symbols
- `composite_key_values` - returns hash of current key values
- `composite_key_string` - returns string representation of composite key
- `composite_key_complete?` - checks if all key parts are set

### 5. Adapter Extensions
- Added `update_with_where` method to base adapter for custom WHERE clauses
- Added `delete_with_where` method to base adapter for custom WHERE clauses

## Usage Example:

```crystal
class OrderItem < Grant::Base
  include Grant::CompositePrimaryKey
  
  connection sqlite
  table order_items
  
  column order_id : Int64, primary: true
  column product_id : Int64, primary: true
  column quantity : Int32
  column price : Float64
  
  composite_primary_key order_id, product_id
end

# Finding by composite key
item = OrderItem.find(order_id: 123, product_id: 456)

# Checking existence
exists = OrderItem.exists?(order_id: 123, product_id: 456)

# Creating new record
item = OrderItem.new
item.order_id = 123
item.product_id = 456
item.quantity = 5
item.save # Would need transaction support to work fully
```

## Limitations:

1. **Transaction Support**: The save, update, and destroy operations require deeper integration with Grant's transaction system. The infrastructure is in place but needs the base transaction methods to check for composite keys.

2. **Associations**: Composite foreign keys for associations are not yet implemented.

3. **Migrations**: Table creation with composite primary keys needs migration support.

## Next Steps:

1. Complete transaction integration for full CRUD support
2. Add composite foreign key support for associations  
3. Add migration helpers for composite key tables
4. Begin Phase 2: Sharding Infrastructure

## Testing:

All implemented features have comprehensive unit tests that pass:
- Configuration detection
- Query methods API
- Helper methods
- Validation behavior

The implementation is ready for use in read-heavy scenarios and provides the foundation for full sharding support.
